# Chapter 1 Checkpoints

## 1.1 - What are hardware and software?
Hardware is the visible / physical elements of a computer.
Software is the instructions that control the hardware and allow it to perform specific tasks.

*(Liang, p. 2)*


## 1.2 - List five major hardware components of a computer
5 major hardware components:
  * A central processing unit (CPU)
  * Memory (main memory)
  * Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
  * Input devices (such as the mouse and keyboard)
  * Output devices (such as monitors and printers)
  * Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards)

*(Liang, p. 2)*


## 1.3 - What does the acronym "CPU" stand for?
CPU stands for central processing unit.

*(Liang, p. 3)*


## 1.4 - What unit is used to measure CPU speed?
Today, CPU speed is measured in megahertz (MHz).

*(Liang, p. 3)*


## 1.5 - What is a bit? What is a byte?
A bit is a digit (0 or 1) in the binary number system.
A byte is the minimum storage unit in a computer. It is made of 8 bits.

*(Liang, p. 3)*


## 1.6 - What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
Memory is for storing programs along with the data used within those programs.
RAM stands for random-access memory.
Memory is called RAM because each byte in memory has a unique address and can be accessed in any order.

*(Liang, p. 4)*


## 1.7 - What unit is used to measure memory size?
Today's computers' memory sizes are generally measured in gigabytes.
  * Kilobyte = approx. 1,000 bytes
  * Megabyte = approx. 1,000,000 bytes
  * Gigabyte = approx. 1,000,000,000 bytes
  * Terabyte = approx. 1,000,000,000,000 bytes

*(Liang, p. 4)*


## 1.8 - What unit is used to measure disk size?
Disk size is usually measured in gigabytes or terabytes.

*(Liang, p. 5)*


## 1.9 - What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
Memory is volatile - any information stored in memory is lost once the system is powered off.
Storage devices permanently store data and can transfer data to memory.

*(Liang, p. 4)*


## 1.10 What language does the CPU understand?

## 1.11 What is an assembly language?

## 1.12 What is an assembler?

## 1.13 What is a high-level programming language?

## 1.14 What is a source program?

## 1.15 What is an interpreter?

## 1.16 What is a compiler?

## 1.17 What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?
